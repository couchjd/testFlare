        <h1>MDTM Error Message</h1>
        <p>This message means that the current FTP site does not support Month-Day-Time-Marking; 
 this means that after the file was uploaded, WS_FTP attempted to preserve 
 the date and time, but the time cannot be preserved by this FTP site. 
 However, files will transfer correctly, and there will be an updated timestamp 
 from the FTP site on the files.</p>
        <p>Note that this is not a fatal error, even though it displays in red. 
 </p>
        <p>You can disable this option by selecting <span style="font-weight: bold;">Preserve 
 filetime on upload (MDTM support required)</span> on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Site 
 Properties: Transfer.</span></p>
