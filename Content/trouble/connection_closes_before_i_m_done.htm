        <p>In addition to the network timeout setting within WS_FTP, there is also 
 a "server timeout" that is determined by the FTP site. Most 
 FTP sites will shut down the connection to a client such as WS_FTP after 
 a few minutes of inactivity. You can change this setting by setting the 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Keep Alive</span>&#160; option on the 
 Site Options dialog in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Advanced </span>tab.</p>
