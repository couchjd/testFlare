            <MadCap:keyword term="Multipart Mode" />Speeding up Large Transfers (Multipart Mode)</h1>
        <p>Large files, such as an architect’s blueprint or a software executable, 
 can take longer to transfer. If you regularly transfer large files, you 
 can use Multipart mode to speed up the transfer. </p>
        <p>When in Multipart mode, WS_FTP splits large files into smaller segments, 
 and downloads all segments via different, yet concurrent, connections. 
 This decreases the total download time for large individual files. </p>
        <p>The number of connections that WS_FTP uses is determined by:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li class="p-Topic-Text-Bulleted">
                <p class="Topic-Text-Bulleted">the number 
 of additional connections specified in the Site: Transfer options </p>
            </li>
            <li class="p-Topic-Text-Bulleted">
                <p class="Topic-Text-Bulleted">the number 
 of connections allowed by the server</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Transfer Manager</span> displays 
 the file, the number of segments that the file has been divided into, 
 and the status of the transfer of each of the segments. When each of the 
 segments are complete, the Transfer Manager shows the status of re-combining 
 the segments into one file, if that process takes longer than 2 seconds.</p>
        <p>If there are no segments listed under the file being downloaded, then 
 the file is not large enough to be divided. </p>
        <p class="Note"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span><span>Multipart works 
 with download files only. It does not work with SSH connections.</span>
