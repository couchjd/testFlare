        <p class="Topic-Text-Numbered" style="margin-left: 5.75pt;">When you connect 
 to a server using the SSL connection option, that server sends you a certificate. 
 If that certificate is not listed on the Trusted Authority tab, or if 
 it was not trusted by a certificate on this list, this window appears.</p>
